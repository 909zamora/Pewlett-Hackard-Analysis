# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis, we used the csvs we created from the asynchronous content to create four additional tables.
Retirement_titles.csv / unique_titles.csv / Retiring_titles.csv / mentorship_eligibility.csv
These tables would help the leadership team of Pewlett Hackard know how many employees were expected to retire, by title and by department. They also would be able to identify employees that could be part of the mentorship program to help the new employees ramp up. Most importantly, the analysis also included the # of employees retiring by title so that the leadership team would know which department would be affected the most. 


## Results

The Below summarizes the amount of people retiring by title from the retiring_titles.csv
count	title
29414	Senior Engineer
28254	Senior Staff
14222	Engineer
12243	Staff
4502	Technique Leader
1761	Assistant Engineer
2	Manager

We can see that Senior engineers are the ones that will be retiring the most in terms of # of employees, followed by Senior Staff, Engineer, etc. THis is useful because it lets us know what departments will need to hire the most and it will prepare them to be proactive about it.
Discovery 1. The company will have to focus on hiring engineers since they make up 2 of their top 3 of retiring employees. 
Discovery 2. The company will not only have to focus on hiring engineers, but they MUST retain their current engineers outside of this retirement group because then they can focus on internal promotions, rather than external hires. 
Discovery 3. Senior Staff have the same dilemna as engineers, where there needs to be a focus on hiring & development/promotions with current employees
Discovery 4. There are not enough people available for the mentorship program that the leadership is trying to create, currently as is, if everyone available for the program were able to participate, they would need to mentor 58 people each to fill the vacating spots of the soon to be retirees. 

##Answer to Qs
There are currently 90,398 vacating spots that could potentially retire. 
There are only 1549 people that could serve as a mentor, so if you do the math, they would need to mentor 58 people each and that is one too many and it would not be feasable.
